# boids
Small C++ project with boids

Hold SPACE to create a repulsion force from the mouse towards the boids
Press R to reset all boids


Heavily influenced by Craig Reynolds' articles on boids, flocking, and steering

I intend to make mass a variable that changes between boids and influences their flight
